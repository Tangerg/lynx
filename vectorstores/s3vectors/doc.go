// Package s3vectors wraps AWS S3 Vectors as a [vectorstore.Store].
// S3 Vectors is a purpose-built, fully managed vector storage tier
// that lives next to regular S3 buckets — vectors live in a *vector
// bucket* under a typed *vector index*.
//
// Requirements: an AWS account with S3 Vectors enabled (currently
// available in a subset of regions), a vector bucket + index
// provisioned out of band (ARM / Terraform / CloudFormation / SDK
// control plane), and an aws-sdk-go-v2 s3vectors client. The store
// does NOT create indexes — index dimensionality / metric / metadata
// schema are declared at index creation.
//
// Distance metrics. S3 Vectors indexes are registered with one of
// `cosine` or `euclidean` at creation. [StoreConfig.DistanceMetric]
// must match the index's registered metric — the store uses it to
// map QueryVectors' raw distance into a higher-is-better score in
// [0, 1].
//
// Filter visitor produces S3 Vectors' Mongo-flavored JSON filter
// document — `{"author": {"$eq": "Alice"}}`,
// `{"year": {"$gte": 2020}}`,
// `{"$and": [...]}`, `{"$not": {...}}`. Metadata keys are addressed
// flat (no nested-path support).
//
// Batching. PutVectors caps at 500 vectors per request; the document
// batcher should produce shards smaller than that. The store passes
// each shard through as one PutVectors call.
//
// Delete. S3 Vectors has no filter-based DeleteVectors — the store
// enumerates ids via paged QueryVectors (1000 per page using a zero
// probe vector since the distance is discarded) and then issues a
// DeleteVectors batch.
//
