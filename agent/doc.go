// Package agent provides the Scope Agent Framework execution kernel.
//
// [Definition] owns immutable behavior and creates serializable [Execution]
// values; [Engine] owns Process lifecycle, [Signal] delivery, [Effect]
// dispatch, child composition, resource bounds, observation, and portable
// snapshots. Strategy payloads stay opaque to the kernel, and persistence
// stays a caller responsibility.
//
// The kernel exists for one purpose: a multi-step agent with children and
// external side effects must resume after a process restart with a stated
// meaning for every operation that was in flight. Everything below follows
// from that.
//
// # The execution waist
//
// Every strategy intersects on exactly two interfaces:
//
//	type Definition interface {
//		Descriptor() Descriptor
//		Start(Input) (Execution, error)
//		Restore(ExecutionState) (Execution, error)
//	}
//
//	type Execution interface {
//		Step(context.Context, []Signal) (Transition, error)
//		Snapshot() (ExecutionState, error)
//	}
//
// The waist is not generic, because the Engine holds heterogeneous definitions
// homogeneously. [Input], [Output], [Signal], [Effect], and [ExecutionState]
// cross it as bounded, defensively copied JSON. Generics belong to edge
// adapters that convert a Go input to raw input and raw output back to a Go
// output; they never enter the contract the Engine has to hold.
//
// # Step
//
// A Step is one cancellable, discardable, purely candidate reduction. It may
// not call a model, run a tool, perform any other external I/O, hide an
// unbounded loop, or start an unowned goroutine. An external operation can
// only be declared as an [Effect] and executed outside the Step.
//
// Three scales explain the kernel: the root tree is the consistency, commit,
// and recovery unit; a Process is the lifecycle and strategy-state isolation
// unit; a Step is the concurrency unit. Adding Processes to a tree adds
// isolated computation and external I/O concurrency, not authoritative commit
// parallelism. Independent commit throughput means separate root trees.
//
// Each root tree has one private commit owner. Pure computation does not
// occupy the owner line: a Process has at most one Step job in flight and
// siblings run in parallel. Only the owner revalidates and adopts a result.
// When a kill, pause, cancel, or a new incarnation expires an attempt, the
// result and its error are discarded whole and the Execution is rebuilt from
// last-stable state.
//
// # Effects and settlement
//
// An Effect is the only way an Execution requests work outside a Step. The
// Engine derives a stable effect identity from the Process identity, step
// sequence, and effect index, then freezes the payload. It interprets only its
// own closed set of framework effects — child, wait, timer — and hands a
// strategy effect whole to the dispatcher its [Deployment] bound. A dispatcher
// never mutates an Execution; it produces deltas and one settlement Signal.
//
// Each effect advances through planned, pending, and settled in declaration
// order, one at a time:
//
//  1. the owner validates candidate state, signal consumption, budget,
//     capability, and batch identity;
//  2. the effect enters pending, and in durable mode the pending boundary
//     commits the whole tree first;
//  3. only then does the dispatcher job start, outside the owner;
//  4. the result is normalized to a definite or an unknown settlement;
//  5. only after the settled boundary succeeds does the owner install the
//     settlement, candidate state, mailbox, and Process transition.
//
// A planned effect that was never dispatched can never become unknown.
// Automatic redelivery is allowed only where replaying one effect identity is
// proven to be the same logical operation; where it is not, an unknown
// settlement stays observable and awaits explicit adjudication. It is never
// silently replayed and never assumed successful. Ephemeral mode runs the same
// state machine without calling the durability port.
//
// # Signals and waiting
//
// A Signal is the only runtime input into an Execution. Repeated submission of
// one signal identity produces exactly one logical consumption. The
// consumption cursor advances only when candidate state and transition commit,
// so a failed Step never permanently swallows input.
//
// A wait identity is minted by the Engine; an Execution cannot generate an
// external one. The Execution declares a logical wait through a [Transition];
// the Engine saves the mapping and enqueues an internal Signal carrying the
// identity; on the next Step the Execution records it and enters Waiting
// explicitly. That round trip keeps the Execution the single writer of its own
// state. The Engine wall clock never enters strategy input — business time is
// submitted as an explicit payload.
//
// Each strategy declares its own safe consumption boundary and proves it with
// contract tests.
//
// # Process lifecycle
//
// A Process moves through [StatusNotStarted], [StatusRunning], and then one of
// [StatusWaiting], [StatusPaused], [StatusCompleted], [StatusFailed],
// [StatusCanceled], [StatusTimedOut], or [StatusKilled].
//
// A terminal state is decided jointly by the recorded control intent and the
// Step result, never inferred from error text or from context.Canceled alone.
// The matrix is matched in priority order: an explicit kill wins; then a
// reached deadline; then parent or host cancellation; then a contract
// violation, external failure, or panic; then legal completion. A committed
// terminal state is first-terminal-wins, so a late cancellation cannot
// overwrite it. An effect's own cancellation first reaches the strategy as a
// settlement Signal — a local failure is never promoted to a Process terminal
// state on its own.
//
// # Recovery
//
// [ExecutionState] is a discriminated envelope of a kind and an opaque
// payload. The kernel constrains the envelope and never interprets the payload
// recursively; each strategy owns and guards its own wire shape. A host may
// persist the envelope but must not parse it by kind and join strategy control
// flow. Recovery finds the Definition through an exact [DeploymentRef]; a
// global kind-to-factory switch is forbidden.
//
// [TreeSnapshot] is the canonical recovery state of a complete root tree.
// [ProcessSnapshot] is a single-Process diagnostic value and is not a recovery
// unit. Events and [Delta] values record attempts and observations only; they
// never substitute for an acknowledged TreeSnapshot.
//
// # Strategies
//
// Three strategies run on this one kernel. The interaction package implements
// ReAct-style model and tool loops with working context, delegates, and
// artifacts. The planning package, with planning/goap, implements goal-driven
// search over immutable actions. The workflow package implements ordered
// deterministic stages over a closed vocabulary, composing through real child
// Processes rather than by nesting a second Execution.
//
// The Engine never imports or type-switches a concrete strategy. A new
// strategy is admitted by implementing the waist plus its own dispatcher,
// codec, and safe consumption boundary.
//
// # Boundaries
//
// The framework owns definition validation, deployment freezing, the Process
// state machine, signal ordering and deduplication, effect identity and
// settlement, budgets, the lifecycle, framework events, and the snapshot and
// recovery protocol.
//
// The host owns product identity, transports, stores and transactions,
// permissions and billing, provider and model selection, when a checkpoint
// commits, and the retention of its own facts. A host depends only on this
// neutral lifecycle contract and never parses a strategy's snapshot payload.
//
// Chat, tools, embeddings, history, and telemetry stay in their own modules.
// Agent reuses them and duplicates none of them.
