// Package web defines provider-neutral web search and page-fetching tools.
//
// [Searcher] and [Fetcher] are independent capabilities because not every
// provider supports both. A provider client may implement either or both;
// each provider owns one package and one transport client. [NewSearchTool]
// and [NewFetchTool] adapt those capabilities to the core tool contract.
